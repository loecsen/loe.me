If unclear or not a goal, set needs_clarification and clarify_question. clarify_question MUST ask for a goal (what to learn or achieve), NOT what to do with an object. When needs_clarification, also provide 2-4 suggested_rewrites (label, next_intent) in intent language. If actionable, give 2-4 angles (label, next_intent).
