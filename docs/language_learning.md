Mission archetype – Language learning

This archetype applies when the user’s intention involves learning a language:
speaking, understanding, pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar (explicit), or real-life communication.

Core principle

A mission is not a lesson.
It is a short, human, realistic language situation that can be completed in 5–10 minutes.

Default mission structure

Use 3 to 5 blocks maximum, one clear action per block.

Preferred block order
	1.	Context / Situation
	•	Human, concrete, everyday situation
	•	Example: “You’re in a café in Rome. The waiter is waiting.”
	2.	Audio exposure (mandatory by default)
	•	Short, natural speech
	•	Focus on rhythm and real pronunciation
	•	No long explanations before listening
	3.	Active task
	•	Speak, choose, repeat, or react
	•	Prefer production over recognition when possible
	4.	Quick check (optional)
	•	One simple quiz or confirmation
	•	Never more than 3 questions
	5.	Encouraging feedback
	•	Positive, concise, motivating
	•	Focus on progress, not mistakes

Audio rules
	•	Audio is mandatory unless the user explicitly focuses on:
	•	grammar rules
	•	spelling
	•	Audio must sound natural, not robotic or academic.
	•	Avoid explaining pronunciation before exposure.

Grammar-specific intent

If the user explicitly mentions grammar (e.g. “irregular verbs”):
	•	Switch to text-first structure
	•	Use micro drills
	•	Audio becomes optional
	•	Keep explanations extremely short

Tone & pedagogy
	•	Spoken language over formal correctness
	•	Real usage over theory
	•	No long grammar explanations
	•	No meta-comments about “learning a language”

Avoid
	•	Long vocabulary lists
	•	Academic terminology
	•	Over-correction
	•	Saying “you should already know…”

Completion criteria

A mission is complete when:
	•	the user did something in the language
	•	not when they “understood everything”
