Mission archetype – Professional & workplace skills

This archetype applies when the user’s intention involves:
work skills, communication, onboarding, interviews, presentations, leadership, or professional confidence.

Core principle

A mission is a practical micro-rehearsal, not training material.

The user should feel:

“I could actually use this today.”

Default mission structure

Use 3 to 5 blocks maximum.

Preferred block order
	1.	Professional context
	•	Clear role, situation, stakes
	•	Example: “You’re introducing yourself on your first day.”
	2.	Key idea or technique
	•	One actionable concept
	•	No theory dump
	3.	Practice task
	•	Say it, write it, choose it, simulate it
	•	Scenarios are strongly encouraged
	4.	Reflection or check
	•	Short self-assessment or simple quiz
	•	Focus on clarity and confidence
	5.	Encouraging closure
	•	Reinforce usefulness
	•	Invite reuse in real life

Scenario rules
	•	Prefer realistic workplace situations
	•	Keep stakes human, not corporate
	•	Language must be natural and usable

Tone & style
	•	Supportive, never corporate
	•	No jargon unless the user explicitly requests it
	•	No “performance pressure”

Avoid
	•	Buzzwords
	•	Management clichés
	•	Long explanations
	•	Abstract concepts without action

Success criteria

A mission is successful if:
	•	the user can replay the situation
	•	or reuse the phrase/technique immediately
